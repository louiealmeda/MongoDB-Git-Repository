# mongovc 
#### (mongo Version Control)
node module for mongodb collection version control support

Source codes are versioned for the team to collaborate easily and safely. Databases needs to be given the same collaboration procedure as business logic has been increasingly dependent on data. A lot of teams dump, restore and merge their versions of databases manually. Which leads to changes not being applied and causes unexpected behaviours.

### Features
- [x] Dump MongoDB collections as a readable files
- [x] Restore MongoDB collections from files
- [x] Create collection groups to specify which collections should be dump or restored 
- [ ] Automatically dump collections on `stat` of git 
- [ ] Automatically dump collections on before `pull` of git to check for conflicts
- [ ] Automatically restore collections after pull if there are no conflicts
- [ ] Connect with Authentication

## Install

```shell
npm install mongovc -g
```

## How to use
Since automatic dump and restore is not yet supported, you can run the commands yourself for now.

### dump collections
```shell
mongovc --dump
```

### restore collections
```shell
mongovc --restore
```

### specifying collections to dump/restore

```shell
mongovc --restore <group name>
mongovc --dump <group name>
```
you can specify groups in the `mongovc.config.js`

if group is not specified, it will use what is indicated in `collections`
